              Rhinos, short for rhinoceroses, are large, herbivorous mammals
              known for their distinctive horns and thick skin. These
              majestic creatures are found in Africa and Asia, with five
              species: the white, black, Indian, Javan, and Sumatran rhinos.
              Each species has unique characteristics and habitats, ranging
              from savannas and grasslands to dense tropical forests.
            </p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              Despite their formidable size and strength, rhinos are
              surprisingly agile, capable of running at impressive speeds
              when threatened. Their horns, made of keratin, are used for
              defense, digging for water, and breaking branches for food.

              The Guardians of the African Grasslands
            </h1>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              Zebras are distinctive members of the equid family, known for
              their unique black-and-white striped coats. Native to Africa,
              zebras primarily inhabit savannas, grasslands, and mountainous
              regions. Their stripes serve multiple purposes, including
              camouflage, confusing predators, and regulating body
              temperature. Each zebra's stripe pattern is unique, much like
              human fingerprints
            </p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              Despite their adaptability, zebras face several threats,
              including habitat loss, hunting, and competition with
              livestock for resources. The conversion of their natural
              habitats into agricultural land reduces their grazing areas
              and water sources.

            <h1 class="article-title">The king of the jungle</h1>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              Lions, known as the "king of the jungle," are majestic big
              cats native to Africa and parts of Asia. These social animals
              are unique among big cats for their pride-based structure,
              with groups typically consisting of several females, their
              cubs, and a few males. Male lions are recognizable by their
              impressive manes, which can vary in color from blond to black
              and symbolize strength and dominance.
            </p>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
              Despite their iconic status, lions face significant threats in
              the wild, primarily due to habitat loss, human-wildlife
              conflict, and poaching. The reduction of their natural
              habitats to agriculture and urban development has led to
              decreased prey availability and increased encounters with
              humans.
